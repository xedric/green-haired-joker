A small repo to demo unit testing in JavaScript for my students

## Technologies used

* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

## Getting started

1. We used [Jests Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html) to setup Jest.
2. We worked on the excersises from [Övningar enhetstest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dfEk85siPS5zaCiuvQKPa5phs6E8M4S8AVuaFWcyJSw/edit#heading=h.e95kwuo4ek8c). Note: excersises in swedish

## Code coverage

Jest supports [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage). Note in [package.json]() the lines:

bla bla

which tells Jest to run the tests with code coverage. Also note [jest.config.js]() with configuration.
